# The Science of Running Economy

Running economy refers to the oxygen cost of running at a given submaximal velocity. Simply put, it's a measure of how efficiently a runner uses oxygen while running at a specific pace. Better running economy means using less oxygen to maintain the same pace, which translates to better performance.

Research has consistently shown that running economy is one of the key determinants of distance running performance, alongside VO2max and lactate threshold. Elite runners often have superior running economy compared to recreational runners, even when other physiological measures are similar.

Several factors influence running economy:

1. Biomechanics: Factors such as stride length, ground contact time, vertical oscillation, and arm movement all impact running efficiency. Studies have found that self-selected stride lengths are generally optimal for running economy.

2. Body composition: Lower body weight, particularly in the extremities, reduces the metabolic cost of running. This is why elite distance runners typically have lean builds.

3. Training adaptations: Specific training can improve running economy through neuromuscular adaptations, increased muscle stiffness, and enhanced storage and utilization of elastic energy.

4. Footwear: Lighter shoes reduce the metabolic cost of running, though this must be balanced with adequate cushioning and support.

Practical ways to improve running economy include:

- Incorporating strength training, particularly heavy resistance training
- Including plyometric exercises to enhance muscle stiffness and elastic energy return
- Running on varied terrain to develop neuromuscular adaptations
- Gradually increasing mileage to improve muscular endurance
- Tempo runs and interval training at race pace

Research by Saunders et al. (2004) suggests that improvements in running economy of just 5% can translate to approximately 3.8% improvement in distance running performance, highlighting its importance for competitive runners.
