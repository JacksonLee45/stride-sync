## Architecture & Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
The application uses Supabase Auth with cookie-based authentication, enabling server-side rendering while maintaining secure user sessions across the entire Next.js stack (middleware, server components, client components).

### Database Schema
The database is structured around several key entities:
- Users (via Supabase Auth)
- Workouts (with specialized subtypes for runs and strength training)
- Training plans and user enrollments
- AI coaching sessions

### Advanced Features

#### AI Coach Implementation
The AI coach leverages Claude's capabilities to:
1. Analyze user goals and fitness level through conversation
2. Generate structured workout plans as JSON
3. Create calendar entries automatically
4. Reference training principles and best practices

#### Row-Level Security
All database access is protected by Supabase RLS policies, ensuring users can only access their own data while maintaining a seamless development experience.

#### Performance Optimization
- Dynamic imports for improved page load performance
- Streaming responses for AI interactions
- SSR for critical pages and CSR for interactive components

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Workout Data Modeling
Creating a flexible data model to support different workout types while maintaining query efficiency required a combination of base tables and specialized extensions. This approach provides type-specific details while enabling unified queries.

### AI Integration
Implementing the AI coach required careful prompt engineering and structured output parsing. The system uses:
- Custom system prompts for guiding the AI's expertise
- JSON response parsing for workout plan extraction
- Stream processing for real-time conversation updates

### Theme System
The application features a fully responsive light/dark theme that seamlessly integrates with third-party components. Custom CSS and theme variables ensure consistent styling across the entire application.

## Future Improvements
- Mobile app using React Native
- Integration with wearable devices and fitness APIs
- Advanced training plan customization and AI-driven adaptations
- Community features and social sharing
